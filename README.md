# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing the implementation of core AI algorithms and concepts.

## Projects

1. **Alpha-Beta Minimax Algorithm**  
   - Implementation of the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimizing decision-making in adversarial games.

2. **Wumpus World**  
   - A knowledge-based AI agent designed for navigating and solving the Wumpus World problem using logical inference and decision-making.

3. **Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Viterbi Algorithm**  
   - Implementation of HMMs for sequence modeling and the Viterbi algorithm for decoding the most probable state sequences.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Artificial-Intelligence-Projects

## Features

- **Alpha-Beta Minimax**: Optimizes game decision trees by pruning unnecessary branches.
- **Wumpus World**: Simulates an AI agent navigating a grid environment with logical reasoning.
- **HMM and Viterbi**: Models probabilistic sequences and decodes the most likely hidden states.

## Notes
Ensure Python 3.x is installed for running the projects.
Each project is modular and can be run independently.
